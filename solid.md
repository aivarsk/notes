For OOP but why OOP in the first place? Why not functional, procedural or a mix of all.


Principles
- Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."[2] In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.[3]
- Openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."[4]
- Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."[5] See also design by contract.[5]
- Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."[6][7]
- Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretes."[8][7]


Right away, OLID suggests there is a base and derived class or an interface and implementation class. Inheritance is overused and bad in most cases (not all), composition is preferred. Creating an interface to break dependency on a single implementation falls in one of these:
- you either duplicate the exact API from implementation to interface making the interface not generic enough for possible future implementations or (most likely) you will not have another implementation making that interface just another boilerplate layer.
- you try to make the interface generic enough but are doing a premature abstraction and predicting the future for no good reason
- you DO have multiple implementations right away. Which is when you do the OLI. Thing to consider: maybe "implementation inversion" leads to cleaner code:
- instead of: a common function that takes an interface to do stuff
- do: different classes call the same utility function with parameters
- meaning: do L somewhere at a higher level, do not push it all the way down

- maybe a matrix with 1, n implementations and XXX on other axis
