For OOP but why OOP in the first place? Why not functional, procedural or a mix of all.


Principles
Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."[2] In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.[3]
Openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."[4]
Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."[5] See also design by contract.[5]
Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."[6][7]
Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretes."[8][7]
